#Luna Sandals: Unboxing
My Luna Sandals arrived in the post this morning, but as I was on the way out to work via the kindergarten, I had to wait until this evening until I could unbox them.

##The Package

I was hoping to be able to take the first photo with an intact envelope but my wife couldn't wait and just went and opened it. Philistine!

##The Contents

Packaging is so prevalent in today's society that we just take it as a give now although it is often _such_ a waste. I'll get of my soapbox now, but suffice to say, I was more than happy to see that all that was in the envelope were the sandals I had ordered :)

## The Soles

The only reservation I had when considering buying a pair of luna sandals was the knot used to tie the lace to the front section of the sandal. Specifically, I was worried that it might make walking slightly uncomfortable. Well the truth is that I really don't notice it.

## The Laces

The sandals come with 72" laces (hemp or leather) as there are 2 tying styles for huaraches: the [traditional method](http://barefootted.com/shop/howtowear.html "Title") or the [slip-on method](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adS1hCuiTe4#t=2m30s). I opted for the slip on method and ended up with a pair of sandals looking like this:

Hmm. How come my lovely sun-kissed legs look so pasty white in that photo? I want to retain the option of tying the traditional way so to avoid cutting the lace, I just wrapped it around itself a couple of times. This holds well without the need to tie.

## The Running

I went for a 5k run in my Lunas the evening after they arrived. All in all it went really well. They are extremely light and, and this is the main reason I bought my pair, enable me to go running in areas where the ground is too rough for barefoot. I did have to stop to adjust them a bit midway through and I think it'll take another few runs to get them sitign correctly on my feet.

The only slight niggle I had was the strap rubbing between my toes (a not too uncommon problem amongst huarache runners, apparently). Landing forefoot causes the foot to want to move against the sandal strap and I ended up with a small blister on my right foot as a result. My left foot was however fine which leads me to believe that this is not an irresolvable issue.
