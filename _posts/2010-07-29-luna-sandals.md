#Luna Sandals: Unboxing
My Luna Sandals arrived in the post this morning, but as I was on the way out to work via the kindergarten, I had to wait until this evening until I could unbox them.

##The Package

I was hoping to be able to take the first photo with an intact envelope but my wife couldn't wait and just went and opened it. Philistine!

##The Contents

Packaging is so prevalent in today's society that we just take it as a give now although it is often _such_ a waste. I'll get of my soapbox now, but suffice to say, I was more than happy to see that all that was in the envelope were the sandals I had ordered :)

## The Soles

The only reservation I had when considering buying a pair of luna sandals was the knot used to tie the lace to the front section of the sandal. Specifically, I was worried that it might make walking slightly uncomfortable. Well the truth is that I really don't notice it.

## The Laces

The sandals come with 72" laces (hemp or leather) as there are 2 tying styles for huaraches: the [traditional method](http://barefootted.com/shop/howtowear.html "Title") or the [slip-on method](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adS1hCuiTe4#t=2m30s). I opted for the slip on method and ended up with a pair of sandals looking like this:

Hmm. How come my lovely sun-kissed legs look so pasty white in that photo? I didn't go for a run in them in the end but will hopefully do so this week and post about the experience
