In the last post, we looked into how to write a query to return array values. We ended up with the following:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title, array_agg(comments.id) AS comment_ids
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
GROUP BY posts.title;
{% endhighlight %}

    +--------+-------------+
    | title  | comment_ids |
    +--------+-------------+
    | Post 1 | {1,2}       |
    | Post 2 | {3}         |
    | Post 3 | {4,5}       |
    | Post 4 | {6}         |
    | Post 5 | {7,8,9}     |
    +--------+-------------+

How would we go about filtering these results? I want to focus on one specific use case. How would I find all post titles having a comment with the id 3? We can do this without aggregating the comment ids:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
WHERE comments.id = 8
{% endhighlight %}

    +--------+
    | title  |
    +--------+
    | Post 5 |
    +--------+

Looks good. How about selecting post titles whose comment ids are a subset of [4, 5]? We'd could write the following:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
WHERE comments.id in (4,5)
{% endhighlight %}

    +--------+
    | title  |
    +--------+
    | Post 3 |
    +--------+

And for our table values this would work as expected. But there is a problem here. Let's say we wanted all posts whose comment ids are a subset of [1,3]. Our above query would return "Post 1" and "Post 2", but that would be incorrect: we only get 'Post 2' as the comment ids for 'Post 1' are not a subset.

Postgres comes with a number of [Array Functions and Operators](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-array.html), one of which may just help us here: the 'contains' function, `@>`. We need to use `array_agg` again and filter using `@>`. Our first naive attempt may be as follows:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title, array_agg(comments.id) AS comment_ids
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
WHERE (1, 3) @> comment_ids
GROUP BY posts.title;
{% endhighlight %}

    ERROR:  column "comment_ids" does not exist
    LINE 3: WHERE (1, 2, 3) @> comment_ids

So how come that didn't work? Well, apparently aliases cannot be used in `WHERE` conditions (but can in ORDER BY). Lets try the following:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
WHERE (1, 3) @> array_agg(comments.id)
GROUP BY posts.title;
{% endhighlight %}

    ERROR:  aggregate functions are not allowed in WHERE
    LINE 3: WHERE (1, 3) @> array_agg(comments.id)

Hmm. That didn't work either. If we want to query *aggregated* data, as is the case when using `GROUP BY`, we need to use `HAVING` instead of where.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
HAVING (1, 3) @> array_agg(comments.id)
GROUP BY posts.title;
{% endhighlight %}

    ERROR:  syntax error at or near "GROUP"
    LINE 4: GROUP BY posts.title;

Bah! Ok - `HAVING` must come after `GROUP BY`.

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title, array_agg(comments.id) AS comment_ids
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
GROUP BY posts.title
HAVING (1, 3) @> array_agg(comments.id);
{% endhighlight %}


    ERROR:  operator does not exist: record @> integer[]
    LINE 3: GROUP BY posts.title HAVING (1,2,3) @> array_agg(comments.id...

Nggh! What does that even mean? Well, to declare an array in postgres, we need to use declare the value as being an array. There are two ways to do this: either `ARRAY[1,3]` or `'{1,3}'` will suffice:

{% highlight sql %}
SELECT title
FROM posts INNER JOIN comments ON posts.id = comments.post_id
GROUP BY posts.title
HAVING ARRAY[1,3] @> array_agg(comments.id);
{% endhighlight %}

    +--------+
    | title  |
    +--------+
    | Post 3 |
    +--------+

Striker!
